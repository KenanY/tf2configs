# KenanY's Team Fortress 2 Configs

My personal TF2 configs. Think of them like dotfiles, but for Team Fortress 2.

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\STEAMUSERNAME\team fortress 2\tf\cfg`

## Launch options

**Remove `-dxlevel 98` from the launch options after the first launch!**

**Fullscreen:** `-dxlevel 98 -full -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd`
**Windowed:**   `-dxlevel 98 -sw -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -noborder -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd`

I personally play Windowed, but with full resolution (so it looks fullscreen, but it's easier to ALT+TAB out of the game). I've heard that this actually degrades performance, but my gaming rig easily makes this hit negligible.

So, for my 1920x1080 monitor, my launch options are:

`-sw -w 1920 -h 1080 -console -noborder -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd`

## Details

### aliases.cfg

Generated by [TF2mate].

### autoexec.cfg

For executing user scripts on launch.

### binds.cfg

My custom TF2 key binds. This is an important file to go through and edit to your preferences. I bind a lot of default stuff because Team Fortress seems to wipe my all movement binds unless I state them here.

  - `c` — my primary key for ducking/crouching.
  - `k` — rolls the dice. If you don't know what this means, you likely don't go on server that have Roll the Dice.

### [class-name].cfg

In these files, you can specify specific binds for each class. There's a ton of possibilities, but I don't use any. Here are some you might like to use (but I give a reason why I don't):

  - `bind "mouse2" "+jump;+duck;+attack"` — If this is enabled, secondary attack will be `+jump;+duck;+attack` when you are playing Soldier. This allows easier rocket jumping, but then **you can't charge the [Cow Mangler 5000].**
  - `alias fakeuber "voicemenu 1 7;say_team "*** FAKED CHARGE ***""` — Fakes Ubercharges. This is for competitive players, not recreational people like me.

### gfx.cfg

I'm using [Chris' highquality config][highquality]. My computer could probably handle a higher quality config, but I'm content with where it's at.

  - FPS cap is commented out due to jittering cause by the [September 2, 2011 patch][20120902].

I'm using _Bad connection_ settings because my ping has been suffering recently.
